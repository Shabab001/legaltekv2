verifications:[
    {line:"A Legaltek's Verification reflects Legaltek's assessment of a given lawyer or Law Firm, based upon the information obtained by or submitted to Legaltek. Someone else's verification of the same lawyer or Law Firm may be very different, or be based upon information at different point in time. A Legaltek Verification is not an endorsement of any particular lawyer or Law Firm, and is not a guarantee of a lawyer's or Law Firm’s quality, competency, or character. Nor is the Legaltek verification a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such lawyer is involved. Rather, the Legaltek Verification process is intended to be a starting point to gather information about lawyers or Law Firms who may be suitable for your legal needs - but you should not rely solely on the Legaltek’s Verification in deciding whether to contact or hire any given lawyer or Law Firm."
